# 🛒 Task 8: Add to Cart Functionality (Frontend Only)

## 🔧 Objective
Simulate a real-world e-commerce cart system entirely on the **frontend** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Users can:
- View products.
- Add products to cart.
- See cart contents and count.
- Remove items from cart.
- View total price.

## 🧩 Features Implemented

- ✅ 8 product cards rendered dynamically from a JS array.
- ✅ Each product has an “Add to Cart” button.
- ✅ Once added, the button changes to “In Cart” and gets disabled.
- ✅ Cart sidebar displays items, total count, and total price.
- ✅ Option to remove products from the cart.
- ✅ Cart can be toggled open/close.
- ✅ Purely frontend-based (no backend/database).
